# SpaceXData
This is a test notebook written for a cooding exercise for Siemens.

The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

Firstly I connect to SpaceX API from the following link "https://api.spacexdata.com/v4" and then retrieve some of the data from the server in the form of JSON objects. 

I save the JSON objects in a dictionary and then try to get some interesting information from the dataset.

In the notebook you can find some info about the company, crew sent to space, payloads sent to space, landings of SpaceX rockets and some info about the most succesfull rocket of SpaceX.


To Run the code: You will need to run it as a Jupyter Notebook. Go to the directory where you have saved the file and run " jupyter notebook " 

Python version: Python 3.7.3
